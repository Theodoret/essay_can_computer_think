An essay for TUM's 2024 application

However, I got rejected because my bachelor's curriculum does not align with the TUM; thus, it is unknown whether this essay is sufficient or not.
Nevertheless, I am quite happy with my writing, so I wish to immortalize it by keeping it in a repository.
I hope my writing may aid the other applicants, goodluck! :)
